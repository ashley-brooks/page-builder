PHP Page Builder

A WP page builder that uses ACF flexible and repeatable content fields.

The page builder script utilises get_template_part() to pull in different page modules as selected in the WP backend, along with any additional settings that come from that.

My plan for this page builder is to convert the script into a PHP Class, to clean up the code and make it more readable.
